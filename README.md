# tiny_oled
This library can drive the Adafruit 1306 128xN and 96xN OLED displays in a text-only mode.

It's meant to be used with tiny devices so it uses I2C only via TinyWireM.  The library doesn't allow bitmap graphics and provides fairly rudimentary TTY control/processing.  It's really meant for debugging and console type applications.
